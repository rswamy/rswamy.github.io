# Hello! I'm Ramya ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer who gradually expanded from 'how things work' to 'why we build them,' leading me to product strategy. Over the years, I've found my sweet spot at the intersection of hardware and software, where I get to solve complex technical challenges while keeping real people at the heart of every solution.

## My Story

The last decade has been quite the adventure! I've co-founded two companies that blend hardware and software (because why choose just one?). Most recently, I led 3D Fab Light, where we worked to make metal laser cutting technology more accessible to creators, students, and businesses.

After 100+ installs with 3D Fab Light, I made the decision to close the company in 2024. This transition has given me time to reflect and get excited about what's next.

## What Drives Me

I'm genuinely passionate about building technology that puts power in people's hands. Throughout my career, I've focused on creating tools that transform users into makers and creators - not just consumers of technology. This probably stems from my years of involvement in STEM education, where I've seen eyes light up when people realize they can actually build the things they imagine. âœ¨

I bring both depth and breadth to my work, with strong technical foundations that branch into diverse areas including:
- Product Development & Strategy
- Team Leadership
- Hardware-Software Integration
- Human-Centered Design
- Educational Technology

## Where I'm at now

I'm looking for my next challenge! While I've spent years in manufacturing technology, I'm excited to apply my experience to new problems.

## Beyond Work

When I'm not at my laptop, you might find me:

- Biking around town ðŸš²
- Helping Bay Area folks discover hidden stories of their local watersheds with [Wholly H2O](https://whollyh2o.org/)
- Tending to my expanding native plant garden
- Working on various hands-on craft projects that keep my maker spirit alive and well
